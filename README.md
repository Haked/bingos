Implementation of all United, Williams, Keeney and Bally bingo pinball machines ever designed using pyprocgame and real EM hardware.

10 total playfields needed, 138 games available.

Each aspect of the bingo pinball machines are lovingly recreated - the game hardware is real and allows for real play and ball control, while the backglass is an LCD monitor and will change with each button press.

There are also remote Raspberry Pi 3 displays mounted on the apron of each playfield that allow for dynamic score/instruction card display currently.

Special thanks to all the bingo pinball collectors and restoration experts that have helped to make this a reality.
