# Bingos!
Implementation of United and Bally bingo pinball machines built using pyprocgame and real E.M. hardware.

Dependencies:
* pygame
* libpinproc
* pypinproc
* pyprocgame

Where I have done the artwork for the games, assets will be included.  Otherwise, I will not
be able to include the backglass images without express permission from the person who completed
the work, and is graciously allowing me to use the images for my personal project.  Please
contact me if you would like permission to use the images at foramusementonlypodcast@gmail.com

There is a small menu system in place that will allow you to choose a game.

Games Emulated:
* Bright Lights
* Coney Island
